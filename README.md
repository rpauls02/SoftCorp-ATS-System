# Team Project - Group 12

A team project partaken in during second year.

Following a provided Initial Statement of Requirements, we've been able to perform the analysis and design stages of the program. Using work completed in these initial stages, and some further through the work presented here, we've been able to develop an application that can fulfil the needs stated.

This repository contains the source code of the developed application which would be our solution to the issue at hand, contributed too by those stated below.

## Contribution 

M. Abdullah - My contribution consisted of the Development/Programming and Testing/QA phases, and a slight amount of System Design. I've designed the interface that'd be used to access the system and any data stored in it, as well as a majority of the logic behind the program.

Mustafa - My contribution consisted of the Development/Programming and Testing/QA phases, and a slight amount of System Design. I've completed and implemeneted research into the hashing algorithms that could possibly be used to secure sensitive data stored in the system.

Robert - My contribution consisted of the System Design and Development/Programming phases, and a slight amount of System Analysis. I've been able to develop a majority of the SQL code used in performing transactions between the system and database.
